# Notes:
# - `torch-geometric` (PyTorch Geometric) often requires additional packages
#   (torch-scatter, torch-sparse, torch-cluster, etc.) and a CUDA-specific
#   wheel. Install it following the official instructions:
#   https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html
# - Pin versions if you need reproducible installs (e.g., `torch==1.12.1`).
